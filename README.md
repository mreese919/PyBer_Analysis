The data collected shows that in the Urban city types total fares per week fluctuate but stay relatively stable when comparing the other city types. Suburban city types have a greater fare fluctuations with fares peaking at the begining of March, dipping at the lowest fares collected at the begining of April. This may coincide with many families and individuals taking Spring Break vacations. These corelations may need further analysises. Leaving the suburban city types which is primarly residential neighborhoods. This is unlike Urban city types which has a combination of residential, commercial and industrial areas. Where resident populations may also remain stable. Rural city types collect the lowest of total fares amoung the cities types however these fares peak along side urban city types. This may have to do with the fact rural city types , like urban city types, consist of a combination of residential, commercial and industrial areas. This analysis show fares collected in city types that have a combination of residential, commercial and industrial areas yield a more stable weekly fare collected. This also shows that all city types have a peak in fares in the begining of March. From this Analysis we may need to look further in to corelations of populations of the areas and dive further into how this affects the total fares and how we can increase profits in all city types.
